Feature: KiwiSaver Calculator

  As a customer I wish to be able to use the KiwiSaver calculator to plan retirement savings


  Background: Navigate to the KiwiSaver calculator page
    Given I click the "KiwiSaver calculator" link under the "KiwiSaver" heading in the menu bar
    When I click the link with text "Click here to get started."


  Scenario: Clicking the information icon beside Current age displays the correct message
    When I click the information icon beside the "Current age" field
    Then I see the "Current age" information message stating "This calculator has an age limit of 64 years old as you need to be under the age of 65 to join KiwiSaver."
